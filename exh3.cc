Description:
  Given a database of soccer player information and a query with constraints
  about a tactic concerning the soccer players, this code will provide the 
  tactic configuration that maximizes the tactic points while satisfying the 
  imposed constraints. (Combinatorial optimization problem)

Input: 
  
  Three files given in order:

  1. The data base of soccer players containing its information: name, 
  position, price, team and points. (data_base)
  
  2. The query containing a tactic realization with the corresponding 
  constariants: the numer of defenders (def), midfielders (mig), strikers (dav),
  and an implicit goalkeeper, the total limit price of the tactic (total_limit) 
  and the maximum limit price for a single player (player_limit).

  3. The output file in which the code will write the best solutions that finds 
  while running. (output_file)

Output:

  Corresponds to the best solution found while running the code with the 
  following information: a double with only one decimal indicating the time 
  needed to find the best solution, the name of: the goalkeeper, defenders,
  midfielders and strikers; poitns, and total tactic price. All these 
  information will be written in the output file with proper format. 

Algorithms:
  Exhaustive search with backtracking.
